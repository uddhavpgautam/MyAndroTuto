Never try to write code(except variable decleration inside class and outside function body.
When function demands String/Int for determining what to you, You can mistakely give some variable of the same type with wrong data in it. This leads to logical error.
Sometimes when the Wrong library gets imported, you may not be able to find desired suggesstions, and hence leading to error with confusion state.

Writing following line between <activity> tag in Manifast makes that activity run as 1st screen
<intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />

                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>

SuperNotCalledException      haha Madness of java

dp is Density independent pixel(basic unit of Masurement)
layout_weight is the % area of parent that layout will cover. 
Hence they are different


Error on xml such as layout and AndroidManifast case R.java to not generate and error  R can't be resulved on project. Be aware

From Fragment we can change the parent Activitiy's View simply by
View view = (View)getActivity().findViewById(R.id.view);

android manages the Image Aspect Ratio, You just have to give image as src for
 ImageView or on ImageButton and then you can set width/height as your wish.

doing  putString to intent  writes the provided key-value pair on bundle associated with intent
Hence you have to  do  intent.getExtra() /* fetch bundle */ and then  bundle.getString(key)
even if you haven't  done intent.putExtra(bundle) on sending side.
